# URL Shortener Microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://url-shortener-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/. Working on this project will involve you writing your code using one of the following methods:

- Clone this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/) and complete your project locally.
- Use our [Replit](https://replit.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener) starter project to complete your project.
- Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the **_Solution Link_** field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the **_GitHub Link_** field.

### HINT: 
Do not forget to use a body parsing middleware to handle the POST requests. Also, you can use the function **_dns.lookup(host, cb)_** from the **_dns_** core module to verify a submitted URL.
